"""
Purpose: Given a int[] list representing the tasks and an int n, return the longest zigzag subsequence. A sequence
    of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between
    positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with
    fewer than two elements is trivially a zig-zag sequence.

    A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence,
    leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Input:
    number_list:  1) a int list of numbers from 1-50 elements
                2) each element is an int between 1-1000
Definition:
    Class:	ZigZag
    Method:	longestZigZag
    Parameters:	int[]
    Returns:	int
    Method signature:	int longestZigZag(int[] sequence)
    (be sure your method is public)
Return:
    The last item in the list.
